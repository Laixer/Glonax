# Operating mode
#
# The operating mode of machine determines which components and
# services are enabled. Default is "normal" mode. The "pilot-restrict"
# mode is used to restrict the machine to only be operated by a
# pilot. The "autonomous" mode is used to enable autonomous operation
# of the machine.

# mode = "normal"
